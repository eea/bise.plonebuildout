====================================================
Plone 4 buildout for http://biodiversity.europa.eu
====================================================

.. contents ::

Buildout is a tool for easily creating identical development or production
environments. This tool gives you the right versions of Zope, Plone products
and python libraries to ensure that every installation gets exactly the same
configuration.

Everything is installed in a local folder. This prevents conflicts with
already existing python and zope packages. Nothing other than this folder
is touched, so the user doesn't need any special priviliges.

There are two configurations available for running this buildout:
 1. one for developers (devel)
 2. one for production (deployment)

Prerequisites - What needs to be installed by sys admin
-------------------------------------------------------
This buildout is intended to run on Linux/Unix-based operating systems. The
buildout has been used and tested on Fedora, Debian, Ubuntu and Mac OS X.

Be sure that you have this software and libraries installed on the server
before you run buildout. These must be globally installed by the server
administrator.

 * python-2.6
 * python-dev (Debian/Ubuntu) / python-devel (RedHat/CentOS)
 * wget
 * lynx
 * poppler-utils (for pdftotext etc)
 * tar
 * gcc
 * make
 * libc6-dev (Debian/Ubuntu) / glibc-devel (RedHat/CentOS)
 * libxml2-devel
 * libxslt-devel
 * libcrypto
 * libsvn-dev and libaprutil1-dev (on Debian/Ubuntu)
 * apr-util-devel and subversion-devel (on RedHat/CentOS)
 * cyrus-sasl-devel (on RedHat/CentOS) or libsasl2-dev (on Debian/Ubuntu) as OpenLDAP dependency
 * wv (used to index Word documents) <http://wvware.sourceforge.net/> (can be installed after Plone install)
 * graphiz, graphiz-devel and graphiz-gd (read more under eea.relations)
 * xpdf and pdftk (read more under eea.converter)
 * ImageMagick ver 6.3.7+ (read more under eea.converter)
 * git
 * libcurl3-dev (Debian/Ubuntu) / curl-devel (RedHat/CentOS)
 * libbz2-dev (Debian/Ubuntu) / libbzip2-devel (RedHat/CentOS)
 * libmysqlclient18 and libmysqlclient-dev (Debian/Ubuntu) / libmysqlclient and libmysqlclient-devel (RedHat/CentOS)

This project also needs access to a MySQL database. Currently there is one that has the
data for the current BISE site. Either that database should be migrated to this server
or provide access from this servers to there.


Run buildout for development
----------------------------
The first time you want to use this buildout you first have to get
all software from github and then run a few commands::

   $ git clone git@github.com:eea/bise.plonebuildout.git
   $ cd bise.plonebuildout
   $ ./install.sh -c development.cfg
   $ ./bin/buildout -c development.cfg

This first three steps only have to be done the first time you use this
buildout. When you later want to update the site because people have committed
changes you do::

   $ cd bise.plonebuildout
   $ git pull origin master
   $ ./bin/develop rb

If you want to use a production database, put your Data.fs in var/filestorage/.

To start the site::

   $ ./bin/instance fg (or start)

To debug::

   $ ./bin/instance debug

Run buildout for production (deployment)
----------------------------------------

The above instructions are for developers.
When running buildout in a production environment one should
pass the configuration argument for deployment::

   $ git clone git@github.com:eea/bise.plonebuildout.git
   $ cd bise.plonebuildout
   $ ./install.sh -c deployment.cfg
   $ ./bin/buildout -c deployment.cfg

The apache config for production is etc/apache-vh.conf

Now buildout will use the production configuration and install ldap product
and other zope/plone products that are not used during web development.

The deployment buildout is based on the ZEO client and server. It installs
several zope instances, one zeo server and one debug instance.

To run the debug instance use::

   $ ./bin/instance fg


Cron jobs to be setup on production and development
---------------------------------------------------

On production::

   $ crontab -e -u zope
   @reboot cd /var/local/bise.plonebuildout && bin/zope-start


Database packing
------------------


Packing is a vital regular maintenance procedure The Plone database
does not automatically prune deleted content. You must periodically
pack the database to reclaim space.

Data.fs should be packed daily via a cron job::

   01 2 * * * /var/local/bise/bise.plonebuildout/bin/zeopack

Logs
------

EEA-CPB for deployment will generate logs from ZEO, Zope, Pound and Apache. All this logs have
a default location and a default size on disk allocated for each of them.

A ZEO server only maintains one log file, which records starts, stops and client connections. Unless you are
having difficulties with ZEO client connections, this file is uninformative. It also typically grows very
slowly â€” so slowly that you may never need to rotate it. In respect of this ZEO log files will not be rotated and
the default location on disk will be:

* /var/local/bise/bise.plonebuildout/var/log/zeoserver.log

Zope client logs are of much more interest and grow more rapidly. There are two kinds of client logs, and each of your clients will maintain both, access logs and event logs. By default the logs will be rotated once they rich 100Mb in size and 3 old log files will be kept. Zope clients will write the logs on disk under /eea.plonebuildout.MY-EEA-PORTAL/var/log/, e.g.:

* /var/local/bise/bise.plonebuildout/var/log/www1-Z2.log
* /var/local/bise/bise.plonebuildout/var/log/www1.log

Logs generated by Pound will be created under /var/local/bise/bise.plonebuildout/var/log/pound.log. This logs
must be rotated using logrotate. System administrators should configure logrotate for example like this::

    # rotate Pound logs for MY-EEA-PORTAL
    /var/local/bise/bise.plonebuildout/var/log/pound.log {
    weekly
    missingok
    rotate 5
    dateext
    compress
    notifempty
    postrotate
      /bin/kill -HUP `cat /var/run/syslogd.pid 2> /dev/null` 2> /dev/null || true
      /bin/kill -HUP `cat /var/run/rsyslogd.pid 2> /dev/null` 2> /dev/null || true
    endscript
    }

Logs generated by Apache will be created under /var/log/httpd/\*.log. This logs must be rotated using logrotate.
Logrotate comes with suitable default configurations for apache/httpd. However, for extra log locations, such as
specific access logs kept under /var/local/www-logs, system administrators should provide additional configuration file(s)
for logrotate; for example, in /etc/logrotate.d/eea we might have something like this::

    # rotate Apache logs for MY-EEA-PORTAL and MY-OTHER-EEA-PORTAL
    /var/local/www-logs/MY-EEA-PORTAL/*.access /var/local/www-logs/MY-OTHER-EEA-PORTAL/access {
    missingok
    notifempty
    sharedscripts
    postrotate
        /sbin/service httpd reload > /dev/null 2>/dev/null || true
    endscript
    }

Logs via Graylog2
-------------------

For Zope logs to rich Graylog2, rsyslog should be installed and configured under /etc/rsyslog.conf similar as it is
under an existing backend (e.g. redsquirrel). Zope clients should send the logs to rsyslog on certain interfaces and
should be configured like bellow::

    event-log-custom =
        <syslog>
            address /dev/log
            facility local4
            format ${:_buildout_section_name_}: %(message)s
            level info
        </syslog>
    access-log-custom =
        <syslog>
            address /dev/log
            facility local1
            format ${:_buildout_section_name_}-Z2: %(message)s
            level info
        </syslog>

In order to have access on `EEA Graylog2`_, an administrator should be asked to give you permissions.

Monitoring
------------

The EEA uses Munin to monitor it's servers. To enable the backend monitoring of your server via Munin follow this `wiki instructions`_.
